## Description

This repository contains two distinct systems for detecting verbal multiword expressions from text. This short description assumes that the reader is familiar with the task; if not, please see link above.

### Dependency tree approach (subdirectory `dep-tree`)


This system attempts to exploit the dependency tree structure of the
sentences in order to identify MWEs. This is achieved by training a
tree-structured CRF model which takes into account conditional
dependencies between the nodes of the tree (node-parent and possibly
node-next sibling). The system is also trained to predict MWE
categories. The tree-structured CRF software used is [XCRF](http://treecrf.gforge.inria.fr/).

### Sequential approach (subdirectory `seq`)

A robust sequential method which can work with only lemmas and morphosyntactic tags. It uses the [Wapiti](https://wapiti.limsi.fr/) CRF sequence labeling software.

## Requirements

* [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) must be installed to compile the *dep-tree* system, including the source libraries (header files)
  * on Ubuntu the most convenient way is to install the package `libxml2-dev`: `sudo apt install libxml2-dev`.
* [CRF++](https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/) must be installed and accessible via `PATH`
* [Wapiti](https://wapiti.limsi.fr/) must be installed and accessible via `PATH`
* The shared task data can be downloaded or cloned from https://gitlab.com/parseme/sharedtask-data
* [XCRF](http://treecrf.gforge.inria.fr/) is also required but provided in this repository

  
  
## Installation

From the main directory run:

```
source setup-path.sh
```

This will compile the code if needed and add the relevant directories to `PATH`. You can add this to your `.bashrc` file in order to have the `PATH` set up whenever you open a new session.

## Usage

### Dependency tree approach

#### Simple training and testing

From the directory `dep-tree`:

```
train-test-class-method.sh -l sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/train.cupt -a sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/dev.cupt conf/minimal.conf model output
```

* `sharedtask-data` is the directory containing the official shared task data, as its name suggests (see link above); replace with the appropriate path.
* `-l` "learn" option: indicates to perform training from the specified file
* `-a` "apply" option: indicates to perform testing on the specified file
* using configuration file `conf/minimal.conf` (see *Configuration files* in section *Details* below)
* `model` will contain the model at the end of the process
* `output` is the "work directory"; at the end of the testing process it contains:
  * The predictions stored in `<work dir>/predictions.cupt`
  * Evaluation results are stored in `<work dir>/eval.out` if `-e` is used (see below).
* if option `-a` is supplied, `-e <training file>` can be used to perfom evaluation. The training file is required in order for the script (provided by the organizers) to count the cases seen in the training data.
* To run the script from a different directory, one has to provide the path to the XCRF directory in the following way:
```
train-test-class-method.sh -o '-x dep-tree/xcrf-1.0/' -l sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/train.cupt dep-tree/conf/minimal.conf model-dir output-dir
```

**CAUTION: RAM ISSUES.** XCRF requires a lot of memory. Depending on the amount of training data, the number of features and the "clique level" option, it might crash even with as much as 64GB. Memory options can be passed to the Java VM (XCRF is implemented in Java) through option `-o`:

```
train-test-class-method.sh -o "-j '-Xms32g -Xmx32g' -x /path/to/xcrf-1.0/" ...
```

#### Multiple config files and datasets

Scripts are provided to allow batch processing. In order to train and test the system each time with a distinct config file and dataset, the script `process-multiple-datasets.sh` can be used to generate the commands to run. This way the tasks can be started in parallel or any way convenient, ideally on a cluster.

```
# generate a few config files
mkdir configs; echo dep-tree/conf/basic.multi-conf | expand-multi-config.pl configs/
# generate the command to train and test for each dataset and each config file
process-multiple-datasets.sh sharedtask-data/1.1/ configs results >tasks
# split to run 10 processes in parallel
split -d -l 6 tasks batch.
# run 
for f in batch.*; do (bash $f &); done
```

### Sequential approach

#### Simple training and testing

From the directory `seq`:

```
seq-train-test.sh -l sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/train.cupt -a sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/test.cupt -e sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/train.cupt conf/example.conf model output
```

* `sharedtask-data` is the directory containing the official shared task data, as its name suggests (see link above); replace with the appropriate path.
* `-l` "learn" option: indicates to perform training from the specified file
* `-a` "apply" option: indicates to perform testing on the specified file
* using configuration file `conf/example.conf` (see *Configuration files* in section *Details* below)
* `model` will contain the model at the end of the process
* `output` is the "work directory"; at the end of the testing process it contains:
  * The predictions stored in `<work dir>/predictions.cupt`
  * Evaluation results are stored in `<work dir>/eval.out` if `-e` is used (see below).
* if option `-a` is supplied, `-e <training file>` can be used to perfom evaluation. The training file is required in order for the script (provided by the organizers) to count the cases seen in the training data.


#### Multiple config files and datasets

Generating multiple configuration files:

```
crf-generate-multi-config.pl  3-4:8:5:1:1:C  >seq.multi-conf
echo "labels=IO BIO BILOU" >>seq.multi-conf
mkdir configs; echo seq.multi-conf | expand-multi-config.pl configs/
```

* Columns 3 and 4 represent the lemma and POS tag, respectively.
* Alternatively, each column (feature) can be given separately, e.g.: `crf-generate-multi-config.pl  3:6:2:1:1:C 4:8:5:1:1:C  >seq.multi-conf`
  * This allows the combination of different patterns for each column so it might improve the model, but at the cost of multiplying the number of combinations (hence increasing the computation time).

Generating the commands and executing the tasks in parallel:

```
seq-multi.sh -e  -t test.cupt sharedtask-data/1.1/ configs/ expe >tasks
# split to run processes in parallel
split -d -l 700 tasks batch.
# run 
for f in batch.*; do (bash $f &); done
```


## Details

### Configuration files

The scripts are meant to be used with configuration files which contain values for the parameters. Examples can be found in the directory `conf`. Additionally, a batch of configuration files can be generated using e.g.:

```
# generates a set of config files (written to directory 'configs')
mkdir configs; echo dep-tree/conf/large.multi-conf | expand-multi-config.pl configs/
```

In order to generate a different set of configurations, either customize the values that a parameter can take in `conf/options.multi-conf` or use the `-r` option to generate a random subset of config files, e.g.:

```
# generate a random 50 config files
mkdir configs; echo dep-tree/conf/large.multi-conf | expand-multi-config.pl -r 50 configs
```


### Conversion to/from BIO format

The two approaches work with a sequential labelling scheme, as opposed to the numbering of the expressions by sentence used in the `cupt` format provided in the shared task. Scripts are provided to convert between the two formats.

#### From cupt to sequential labelling scheme (e.g. BIO)

```
cupt-to-bio-labels IO sharedtask-data/1.1/FR/train.cupt fr-train.io
```

* Note that the conversion entails a simplification, i.e. loss of information: in the cases of overlapped or nested expressions, the program discards one of the expressions (the shortest). 
  * By default it adds the tokens corresponding to the discarded expression as if they belonged to the preserved expression. Alternatively, if `-k` is supplied, the tokens of the shortest expressions are not added to the other.
* The labelling scheme must be one of:
  * `IO`: only mark tokens as belonging to an expression or not
  * `BIO`: special mark `B` for the starts of a token; this allows the detection of multiple expressions by sentence
  * `BILOU`: more sophisticated labelling scheme with `L` for last token and `U` for unit expressions.
* Categories:
  * "joint": by default the program keeps the categories of the expressions as a suffix, thus generating a number of distinct labels up to three times the number of categories (if  using BIO).
  * "indep": option `-c <category>` makes the program focus on a single category of expressions and ignore the others. This allows the training of independent models, one by category.
  * "none": option `-i` makes the program ignore cateogries and process all the expressions as if they all belong to the same category.


#### From sequential labelling scheme (e.g. BIO) to cupt

```
bio-to-cupt-labels fr-train.io fr-train.cupt
```

* See also `merge-independent-labels` in order to merge categories back together after predicting them independently.


### Collecting results

Scripts are provided to collect results from a large experiment with multiple datasets and configurations, and store the results is tab-separated file with columns representing the parameters in the config file. The resulting file can then be analyzed more easily.

```
echo -e "configs\tresults" | collect-results-multiple-experiments.sh  results.tsv
```

* `configs` is the directory containing the set of config files used in the experiment (see above).
* `results` is the output directory, which must contain a file `results/<dataset>/<config>/eval.out` generated at the end of the training+testing process for each case.

Example: extracting best performance by language (based on results collected from sequential approach experiments)

```
for f in sharedtask-data/1.1/??; do l=$(basename $f); cat results.tsv | grep $l | grep Tok | sort -k 14,14n | tail -n 1 | cut -f 2,3,4,8,913,14; done
```
